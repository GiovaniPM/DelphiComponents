# Delphi 7.0 Components Collection

## [RXLib](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rxlib/)

>This is a set of components for Borland Delph and C Builder.
> 
>While these are completely free as well, they are actually already included in JVCL. Use this set if you'd rather have these specific ones and not the others that come with JEDI Visual Component Library.

## [JEDI Visual Component Library (VCL)](http://jvcl.delphi-jedi.org/)

>The JVCL is built from code donated by the JEDI community. It consists of hundreds of VCL components that can be instantly reused in your Delphi, and potentially Kylix, projects.
>
>The entire JEDI VCL is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (â€‹MPL), and can be freely used in freeware, shareware, open source, and commercial projects.

## [Max's Components for Delphi](http://torry.net/authorsmore.php?id=3079)

>Visit this download page for 11 free Delphi components, each with a complete description of its features. Among others, there's one for inserting a symbol dialog in word processor apps and another that's a debugger tool for Borland Delphi.
>
>Instead of being able to get these in bulk like the components from above, you have to download each of them individually, but it's quick and easy.
>
>There is a twelfth one here but it's not free, and only includes a trial.
